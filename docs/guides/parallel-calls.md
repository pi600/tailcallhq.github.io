## Performing Sequence and Parallel Calls in Tailcall

Tailcall's API Gateway is crafted to effortlessly manage both sequential and parallel calls, enhancing data retrieval for better performance. This guide will walk you through the steps of making sequential and parallel calls using Tailcall.

### Understanding Sequential and Parallel Calls

**Sequential Calls:**  In a sequential call, requests are made one after the other, and each subsequent request depends on the response of the previous one. This is akin to a step-by-step execution where the next action relies on the outcome of the preceding one.

**Parallel Calls:** In parallel calls, multiple requests are made simultaneously without waiting for the completion of one before initiating the next. This approach significantly reduces the overall time required to fetch data.

### Making Sequential Calls

Tailcall allows for implicit sequential calls when dependencies exist between entities. Let's consider an example where we fetch user details first and then retrieve their posts

```graphql
type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User @http(path: "/users/{{args.id}}")
  postsForUser(id: ID!): [Post] @http(path: "/users/{{args.id}}/posts")
}
```

 when requesting `postsForUser` the user query happens first by default, showcasing implicit sequential behavior. This means, when asking for posts, Tailcall ensures the necessary user details are fetched beforehand, streamlining the process without explicit user intervention.

 ### Making Parallel Calls

 Tailcall automatically identifies opportunities for parallelization based on the absence of dependencies. Let's consider an example where we want to fetch details of multiple users simultaneously

 ```graphql
 type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User @http(path: "/users/{{args.id}}")
  allUsers: [User] @http(path: "/users")
}
 ```

 In this case, the `user` queries within the `allUsers` query can be executed in parallel since they don't depend on each other. Tailcall intelligently handles this parallelization without requiring explicit user intervention.

 ### Leveraging Tailcall's Efficiency

 Tailcall's underlying architecture is designed to optimize performance automatically. Here is how Tailcall achieves efficient data retrieval

**1. Dependency Resolution:** Tailcall analyzes the schema to identify dependencies between entities. It ensures that queries are executed in the correct order to satisfy dependencies.

**2. Parallelization:** Tailcall recognizes independent queries and executes them in parallel whenever possible. This is particularly beneficial when fetching data for multiple entities simultaneously.

**3. Smart Caching:** Tailcall intelligently caches responses, minimizing redundant calls. Cached data is utilized when available, enhancing response times.


Best practices for using Tailcall include expressing dependencies clearly in your GraphQL schema to enhance clarity and ensure predictable execution. It's advisable to optimize parallel calls by leveraging Tailcall's ability to execute independent queries simultaneously, thereby improving overall efficiency in data retrieval. Regularly monitoring and analyzing your Tailcall setup, along with utilizing its performance metrics, enables you to identify optimization opportunities. In conclusion, Tailcall's seamless handling of both sequential and parallel calls allows developers to focus on schema design, resulting in APIs with exceptional performance and responsiveness.
